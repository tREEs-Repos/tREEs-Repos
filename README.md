#### üõà About Me: üõà
Hello! My name is tREEs, and I'm a computer science student and hobbyist developer with a passion for all things IT.

This Github account was created to host some of my code for personal use and to gain experience building projects for a potential 
portfolio. Valuing clean, readable, and maintainable codebases, I strive to provide the best quality in every repository. I am 
constantly refactoring existing code and eager to learn and improve, Feedback or reports of bugs/issues is always appreciated. Feel free to reach 
out via Github with any comments or concerns.

Strongly believing in the power of collaborative coding, I advocate for Open Source code to ensure it can be scrutinized by the public, 
closing any vulnerabilities or security holes. 

It is a privilege to share my work on this platform.

üôèüèª Thank you for your interest in my Github account! üôèüèª
