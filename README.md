<!--- Section: About Myself and My Values as a developer--->
#### üõà About Me: üõà
My name is tREEs and I'm a student of computer science and hobbyist developer who is passionate about all things IT.

I created this Github account in order to host some code online for personal use, and to get some experience building 
Projects that would contribute towards a portfolio if I ever seek employment as a developer. I value what I consider to
be clean, readable and maintainable codebases and strive to provide this to the best of my ability in every repository.
I am constantly refactoring existing code and always looking to learn and improve, so if you have any feedback or you
encounter bugs / issues with any of these tools, feel free to reach out via Github and let me know!

I strongly believe in the power of collaborative coding even though I work alone in most of my projects. I believe all
code should be Open Source in order for it to be scrutinized by the public and close any vulnerabilities or security holes,
and I view it as a priviledge to be doing this for you on this platform.

üôèüèª Thankyou for your Interest in My Github Account! üôèüèª
